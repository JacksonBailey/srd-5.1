SRD 5.1
=======

For legal information please see the [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md) file.

It mentions a [webpage][srd-info] to find the SRD but it is not there yet. I
believe they have not updated it yet. The new SRD was released on a
[blog post][blog-source]. [Here][srd-5.1-cc] is a direct link to the download.
