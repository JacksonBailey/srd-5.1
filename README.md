SRD 5.1
=======

For legal information please see the [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md) file.

The Systems Reference Document (SRD) is available from this [webpage][srd-info].
In theory there should not be changes but since this repository's creation it
has changed. (Check this repo's history and see page 1 for an example.) I am not
going to do a line-by-line diff to find the exact content changes. I believe it
is safe to assume new versions (at least of the SRD 5.1 specifically) will only
be minor formatting changes and perhaps spelling and grammar fixes.
